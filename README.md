# Overview
The goal for this project is to develop a site dedicated to mini itx gaming pc's. The community is growing every day, however the only active community for mini itx gaming pc's is inside of Reddit. 

I am personally not a reddit user, and don't like to engage in social media as much as possible. When I want to look at mini itx gaming pc's, I just want to see others creativity and work. I don't want to see adds, negative news, or the often negative reddit community. 

I want to create a site that is only for mini itx gaming pc's. A forum of sorts for users to share their builds and parts. Sharing what can and can not work is key in the mini itx community, as everyone is able to work together to optimize there builds. 

This project will be built using the PERN stack. 

PERN Stack Used: 

PostgreSQL, 

Typescript Node.js,

Typescript React,

Tailwind CSS,

Docker
